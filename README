Redmine Issue Changesets View Link Github plugin
by Ippei Ukai

This plugin changes Changesets view (the list of associated revisions) in the Issue view to link GitHub instead of Redmine's builtin repository browser.

Please set the GitHub user/repository in plugin's configure page for those projects that you want to replace the link with GitHub's URL.

The plugin probably does work with Redmine 1.4, but its multiple repository per (sub)project is not supported.
